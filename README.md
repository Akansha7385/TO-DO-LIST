# TO-DO-LIST
This is a basic TO-DO list web application that allows users to add tasks, mark them as completed, and delete them. The tasks are saved in the browser's local storage, so they persist even after the page is refreshed or closed.

# Technologies Used
1. HTML: For structuring the content of the page.
2. CSS: For styling the application and making it visually appealing.
3. JavaScript: For handling the logic of adding, completing, and deleting tasks, as well as managing local storage.
4. Google Fonts (Poppins): A custom font from Google Fonts to enhance the typography.
